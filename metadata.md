## Research Group Contributions

As a member of the Junior Seminar research group, document how you contributed
to the research community beyond your individual project. This section reflects
the collaborative nature of research work and your engagement with fellow
researchers.

### Peer Research Feedback

Document significant feedback you provided to other research group members
during presentations, demonstrations, or informal discussions. Include:

- **Researcher Name / Project**: [Name of peer researcher and their project]
- **Feedback Provided**: \[Brief description of the feedback, suggestions, or
  questions you contributed\]
- **Impact**: [If applicable, note how your feedback influenced their work]
- **Reference**: [Provide a link to a GitHub repository's issue tracker]

Example entries:

- **Student Name One / Machine Learning Bias Detection**: Suggested examining
  fairness metrics beyond accuracy; Jane incorporated demographic parity analysis
  into her evaluation framework
- **Student Name Two / Distributed Caching System**: Asked about handling
  network partitions during demo; led to important discussion about consistency
  models
- **Student Name Three / Graph Algorithm Visualization**: Recommended adding
  real-time performance comparison; Alex added this feature in Week 12

### Technical Discussions and Problem-Solving

Document instances where you participated in collaborative technical
discussions or helped fellow researchers troubleshoot issues:

- **Discussion Topic / Problem**: [Brief description]
- **Your Contribution**: [What you shared, suggested, or helped debug]
- **Outcome**: [How it helped advance the research]

Example entries:

- **Docker Containerization Issues**: Shared my Dockerfile configuration and
  helped three researchers set up their development environments
- **Statistical Testing Discussion**: Explained paired t-tests vs. Wilcoxon
  tests; helped multiple researchers choose appropriate tests for their
  experiments
- **GitHub Actions Debugging**: Collaborated with two researchers to fix CI/CD
  pipeline failures; documented solution in group Slack channel

### Research Group Meeting Participation

Note particularly meaningful contributions during research group meetings:

- **Meeting Date / Topic**: [When and what]
- **Contribution**: [Question asked, insight shared, or resource provided]
- **Value to Group**: [How it benefited the research community]

Example entries:

- **Week 4 / Research Ethics Discussion**: Raised important questions about
  data privacy in web scraping projects; led to productive discussion about
  `robots.txt` and ethical boundaries
- **Week 9 / Writing Workshop**: Shared effective strategies for writing
  related work sections; multiple researchers found it helpful because it
  clarified the way they should structure the second chapter of their report
- **Week 11 / Results Visualization**: Demonstrated `matplotlib` customization
  techniques; several researchers adopted similar approaches

### Research Resources Shared

Document any research papers, tools, tutorials, or other resources you shared
with the research group that helped advance collective knowledge:

- **Resource**: [Paper title, tool name, tutorial link, etc.]
- **Shared With**: [Individual researcher or entire group]
- **Purpose**: [Why you shared it and how it was relevant]

Example entries:

- **"Testing in Production" Paper**: Shared with entire group during Week 7;
  relevant for multiple systems research projects
- **Plotly Visualization Tutorial**: Shared with four researchers working on
  data-heavy projects; enabled interactive visualizations
- **arXiv Paper on Neural Architecture Search**: Shared with Sarah Lee for her
  AutoML project; became a key reference in her related work chapter
