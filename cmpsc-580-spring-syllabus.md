# CMPSC 580: Junior Seminar in Computer and Information Science

## Introduction

Your Junior Seminar course affords you the opportunity to pursue independent
research in computer science, software, engineering, data science, or
informatics. This course parallels the kinds of intense inquiry and research
inherent to both academic life and a career as a computer scientist, software
engineer, or data scientist. To that end, you will work closely with your first
reader to explore rich, complex research projects in a single-semester format.
Though the faculty cannot promise that this work will be frustration- or
challenge-free, we invite you to pursue it with great enthusiasm, vigor, and to
--- above all --- find joy in the process.

**We are not a class, we are a research group!** This fundamental principle
shapes everything we do this semester. You are not a student completing
assignments; you are a junior researcher conducting original work. Your first
reader is not a teacher grading homework; they are your research adviser guiding
your scholarly development as a researcher in the field of computer and
information science. Our meetings are not lectures; they are research
discussions, presentations, and collaborative problem-solving sessions. Your
prototype, report, and journal are not coursework; they are research artifacts
that contribute to the broader scholarly conversation in computer and
information science. Embrace this identity: you are a member of a research
laboratory working alongside other researchers toward advancing knowledge in
your field.

## Course Description

An investigation of select topics in computer and information science that
prepares students for the completion of a senior project with the purpose of
identifying knowledge gaps in the discipline. Students learn how to read
scholarly papers, state and motivate research questions, create a software
prototype or develop scholarly artifacts to address their findings, and collect
and organize evidence for evaluating the outcome of their project. During a
weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to gain
practical skills in technical writing, the presentation of technical concepts,
and the production of an artifact. Students are invited to use their own
departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are
available for use during class and lab sessions.

- Prerequisite: Permission of the Instructor
- Distribution Requirements: `None`

## Research Group Meeting Structure

The Junior Seminar research group meets three times per week with the
following structure:

- **Monday (50 minutes)**: Junior researchers only. Focus on research
  presentations, brainstorming sessions, prototype demonstrations, and peer
  critique of research progress.

- **Wednesday (50 minutes)**: Junior researchers only. Continuation of Monday's
  research activities with additional presentations, technical discussions, and
  collaborative problem-solving.

- **Friday (50 minutes)**: Joint research meeting with Senior Seminar (e.g.,
  CMPSC 600 and 610) researchers. Collaborative sessions on research
  methodologies, technical writing for publication, presentation skills for
  conferences, research ethics, and professional development in computing
  research.

The Friday joint meetings provide valuable opportunities for junior
researchers to learn from senior researchers' experiences and for
seniors to mentor juniors in the research process. All research group
members benefit from the broader perspective on research practices
across different stages of the undergraduate research trajectory.

## Research Group Faculty

- [Oliver Bonham-Carter](https://www.oliverbonhamcarter.com/)
- [Janyl Jumadinova](https://janyljumadinova.com/)
- [Gregory M. Kapfhammer `**`](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/)
- [Douglas Luman](https://www.cis.allegheny.edu/sites/dluman/)

The faculty member with the `**` symbol after their name is the research group
coordinator who is responsible for orchestrating all aspects of the CMPSC 580
research group. If you have any high-level questions about the research group,
please contact both the course coordinator who also serves as your research
adviser in CMPSC 580. In the follow-on Senior Seminar that you enroll in next
year, each researcher will be assigned one first reader who will serve as their
primary research adviser throughout the semester.

## Course Details and Learning Outcomes

### Course Details

Independent research in computer science culminating in the development
of a research prototype, a complete five-chapter research report, and a
research journal. Must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Students are
invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course;
a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab
sessions.

### Learning Objectives

- Develop a viable and appropriate proposal for an independent and
  open-source research project.
- Describe a research process, its methods, and outcomes in writing in
  the form of an incremental research notebook and two chapters of a
  formal thesis document.
- Present and communicate complex ideas in a variety of media through
  both informal discussions, peer reviews and formal presentations.
- Produce and document a working prototype of computational artifact.
- Evaluate the produced prototype and reflect on theoretical, practical,
  ethical and social impact of the proposed artifact.
- Produce an original project that includes integration of theory and
  practice or software and hardware.

## Assessment Strategy

### Assessment Categories

For the purposes of evaluation, this course is separated into both
"primary" and "secondary" requirements, as explained in the following
table. This table includes the name of the deliverable, its
categorization as either a primary or a secondary requirement, and the
assigned percentage of the overall course grade. All of these
percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so presents itself,
the course coordinator may, for instance, change the assigned
percentages during the academic semester.

|**Deliverable** |**Category** |**Percentage** |**Grading** |
|:--------------------------------|:------------|:--------------|:-----------|
|Research Journal (7 entries) |Secondary |10% |Revisable |
|Class Participation |Secondary |5% |Cumulative |
|Adviser Meetings |Secondary |5% |Cumulative |
|Research Prototype |Primary |20% |Revisable |
|Research Idea Pitch Presentation |Primary |10% |Final |
|Prototype Demonstration |Primary |10% |Final |
|Research Results Presentation |Primary |10% |Final |
|Five-Chapter Research Report |Primary |30% |Revisable |

**Important Note on Assessment Types:**

- **Final Assessment**: Presentations and demonstrations receive a grade upon
  completion that becomes the final (i.e. non-revisable) grade for that
  deliverable. These grades are not subject to revision.

- **Revisable Assessment**: Research journal entries, the research
  prototype, and research report chapters receive initial grades that
  may be revised based on improvements made in subsequent submissions,
  culminating in a final grade at the end of the semester.

- **Cumulative Assessment**: Class participation and adviser meetings are
  evaluated continuously throughout the semester based on consistent engagement
  and effort.

To pass `CMPSC 580`, submission of and participation in all the primary
requirements is mandatory. In addition to an overall evaluation of each
category, a student's work in `CMPSC 580` will be evaluated according to each of
the following baseline requirements. Please note that these requirements
articulate a baseline for the junior seminar course and are provided as a list
of minimum requirements that all specific research deliverables must meet to be
assessed as complete. Before the submission of a final grade, a student's
assessment scores for these categories will be assigned by the course
coordinator and reviewed by the faculty members who are affiliated instructors
for `CMPSC 580` at Allegheny College.

#### Research Prototype

**The prototype is revisable**: Your first reader will provide feedback
on your prototype throughout the semester. You can continue to improve
your prototype's code, documentation, and functionality. Your final
prototype grade will be based on the state of your GitHub repository as
of the final submission deadline (May 1, 2026). Note that the prototype
demonstration in Week 7 receives a separate final grade that is not
revisable.

**Prototype Requirements**: Your research prototype must demonstrate both
**feasibility** and **challenge**. It should show that your research idea is
technically achievable within one semester while also demonstrating that it
pushes your skills and explores meaningful concepts from computer science,
software engineering, data science, and informatics. A prototype that is too
simplistic (e.g., a basic web form or a simple command-line tool) won't
adequately support research, while one that is overly ambitious (e.g., a full
operating system) won't be completable in time and thus won't demonstrate
feasibility.

**Prototype Examples**: The following examples illustrate appropriate prototypes
across different areas of computer science. While each project suggestion
balances feasibility with challenge, they a provided for illustrative purposes
only and do not represent a research project that is guaranteed to earn a strong
final grade in the Junior Seminar course. You must work with your first reader
to identify your own prototype and completed it in the required timeframe.

*Algorithm and Theory*:

- Custom implementation of a novel graph algorithm variant with performance
  benchmarking against standard libraries
- Interactive visualization tool for demonstrating complexity classes with
  real-time algorithm comparison
- Probabilistic data structure implementation (e.g., Bloom filters, count-min
  sketch) with study of empirical accuracy
- Benchmarking framework that enables the empirical characterization of the
  worst-case performance of an algorithm's implementation

*Software Engineering*:

- Static analysis tool that detects specific code patterns or security
  vulnerabilities in Python or JavaScript
- GitHub Action or plugin that automates testing, documentation, or
  code quality checks
- Refactoring tool that transforms code between different design
  patterns with validation
- Custom linter or formatter with configurable rules for a specific
  programming language

*Data Science and Machine Learning*:

- Data pipeline for collecting, cleaning, and analyzing social media
  or web data with statistical tests
- Interactive dashboard for exploring dataset characteristics and
  visualizing statistical patterns
- Implementation and comparison of multiple classification algorithms
  on a domain-specific dataset
- Bias detection tool that analyzes datasets or model predictions for
  fairness metrics

*Systems, Networking, and Distributed Systems*:

- Custom HTTP server or client with specific features (e.g., caching,
  compression, authentication)
- Network protocol implementation with packet analysis and performance
  measurement
- Container orchestration tool or plugin that manages deployments with
  health monitoring
- Distributed system simulation demonstrating consensus algorithms or
  fault tolerance

*Human-Computer Interaction and Informatics*:

- Usability testing framework that collects interaction metrics and
  generates reports
- Accessibility evaluation tool that tests websites against WCAG
  guidelines with recommendations
- Mobile or web application with A/B testing capability for comparing
  interface designs
- Browser extension that modifies web interfaces and logs user
  interaction patterns

*Security, Privacy, and Cryptography*:

- Password strength analyzer with entropy calculation and policy
  enforcement
- Network traffic analyzer that detects suspicious patterns or
  protocol violations
- Privacy-preserving data sharing tool using differential privacy or
  secure computation
- Cryptographic protocol implementation with security property
  verification

Remember that your prototype should enable your experimental work. For example,
if you're comparing algorithms, your prototype should implement those algorithms
and provide benchmarking capabilities. No aspect of an empirical study for this
prototype should require human subjects as this would necessitate IRB approval
that is not feasible in the timeframe of this course. Ultimately, you should
ensure that your prototype meets the following baseline requirements:

- [ ] The prototype's source code exists in a publicly available
  GitHub repository
- [ ] The prototype's repository contains comprehensive installation
  instructions
- [ ] The prototype's repository contains clear usage documentation
- [ ] The prototype can be installed and used by someone other than
  the creator
- [ ] The prototype's repository demonstrates software development
  best practices (e.g., meaningful commit messages, organized file
  structure)
- [ ] The prototype addresses the research problem described in the
  report
- [ ] The prototype's repository contains evidence of regular commits
  throughout the semester
- [ ] The prototype demonstrates appropriate technical complexity for
  junior-level work
- [ ] The prototype includes adequate error handling and validation
- [ ] The prototype's repository contains clear examples and
  demonstrations
- [ ] The prototype successfully supports the experimental work
  described in the report

Again, it is important to stress that your prototype must be substantial enough
to support a full research report while being achievable in a single semester.
You should aim for depth over breadth—it's better to thoroughly explore one
aspect than to superficially cover many.

### Additional Details for Research Presentations

**Research Group Structure**: With approximately 20 researchers in the group,
presentations are divided across Monday and Wednesday research meetings (10
researchers per day) during the assigned weeks. Each 50-minute research meeting
accommodates all 10 presentations with strict time limits.

- **Research Idea Pitch Presentation (Week 6)**:

  - Project presentation: 3 minutes
  - Question and answer session: 2 minutes
  - Total time per researcher: 5 minutes
  - Total meeting time: 50 minutes for 10 researchers

- **Research Prototype Demonstration (Week 7)**:

  - Prototype demonstration: 3 minutes
  - Question and answer session: 2 minutes
  - Total time per researcher: 5 minutes
  - Total meeting time: 50 minutes for 10 researchers

- **Research Results Presentation (Week 13)**:

  - Results presentation: 3 minutes
  - Question and answer session: 2 minutes
  - Total time per researcher: 5 minutes
  - Total meeting time: 50 minutes for 10 researchers

- Presenting researchers must strictly adhere to the stated time limits.
  Given the tight schedule with 10 presentations per research meeting,
  going over time is not possible as it would prevent other researchers
  from presenting their work.

- All research group members are required to attend and participate as
  active audience members in all presentations on both Monday and
  Wednesday of the assigned presentation weeks. This is part of your
  contribution to the research group.

- **Programming Language Tools**: As required by your specific research project
- **GitHub Account**: For repository hosting and collaboration

Students should ensure their development environment is set up early in the
semester to avoid technical issues when deadlines approach.

## Course Policies

### Course Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend the course sessions. If, due to
extenuating circumstances, you will not be able to attend a session, then,
whenever possible, please communicate with the course coordinator at least one
week in advance to describe your situation. Students who have any signs of
illness should not attend any in-person course sessions and should contact the
course coordinator as soon as possible.

Attendance is especially critical during the following weeks:

- Week 6: Research Idea Pitch Presentations
- Week 7: Research Prototype Demonstrations
- Week 13: Research Results Presentations

### Email Policy

Despite the fact that the majority of our communication relies on the [Computer
and Information Science 580 Organization on
GitHub](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-580-S2026), the faculty
will also use email to communicate significant information. As with other
platforms used by this course, it is your responsibility to be accountable for
email communication. Please check your Allegheny email regularly.

### Syllabus Revision

The faculty of the Department of Computer and Information Science reserve the
right to make changes to this syllabus document. Should a change occur, they may
be discussed with the members of the course community. Minor revisions to
wording that do not impact course events or deliverables may be made without
notice. Any change which impacts dates or significant changes in student
responsibility will be communicated -- in writing -- at least one week in
advance of the due date of the deliverable affected.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor
Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment.
Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the
Department of Computer and Information Science adds the following
statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in
> any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from
> thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow
> students. Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary to
> distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the
> principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who
> produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on,
> someone else's work. It will therefore be understood that all
> assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer and
> Information Science are to be the original work of the student
> submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with
> the provisions of the Honor Code. Appropriate action will be taken
> when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work
> of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change
often, the department encourages you to periodically review the
specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the
latest course catalog and in the _Compass_. The above statement, of
course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow or text
generation systems such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot. Please review the
policy on the use of artificial intelligence tools, referenced in this
syllabus, for more suggestions concerning the effective use of tools
like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot.

### Classroom Ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its
members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. The faculty
encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM) [Code of
Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics).

### Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools

The course instructors recognize that use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools
such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, and other large language models has
emerged as a professional skill set in the knowledge and practices our
coursework covers. Department faculty maintain a permissive attitude toward
these tools by recognizing that you can and will use them. We do so considering
the following position:

> As a skill, using and correctly applying the results derived from AI tools is
> both context-based and discretion-worthy: these tools do not always provide
> correct or workable answers. Industry veterans and expert users run into many
> situations in which the responses these algorithms provide are plainly
> incorrect or unfit. In the context of department coursework, accepting an
> AI-generated answer wholesale or as a small part of an assignment may lead to
> less-than-satisfactory results in the context of both learning and deliverable
> quality.

> As a learner, your time at Allegheny is meant to impart the knowledge that
> enables you to judge the fitness of a given approach, regardless of its
> origin. In the same way that CIS students employ compilers, integrated
> development environments, and refactoring tools, the use of an AI tool is not
> a substitute for developing the fundamental skills that develop this
> awareness. Importantly, research demonstrates that relying on generated
> responses reduces a learner's ability to durably learn these lessons and
> skills, suggesting that you should cautiously embrace the use of AI when you
> complete CIS coursework<sup>†</sup>.

Be prepared to support their use in ways including but not limited to:

- Citing instances where code or text has been generated and clearly defining
  the tools that generated them
- Providing descriptive commentary (including prompts) around generated code or
  text either in in-line comments or assignment documentation
- Considering improvements to the generated content, documenting specifics about
  your modifications and reasoning behind them
- Revising the generated code or documentation so as to ensure that it is more
  suitable for the purposes of your research
- Being able to explain any code or text that you include in your work,
  regardless of its source

Faculty do not intend these requirements as a "gotcha"; we assume the best of
your effort. These guidelines follow industry best practices and prepare you for
integrating current and future generations of these AI technologies into your
set of computational skills.

**Important Note for Research Writing**: While AI tools can be helpful for
brainstorming, outlining, and improving clarity, your research report must
reflect your own understanding, analysis, and voice. Direct copying of
AI-generated text without significant modification and attribution is not
acceptable. Your readers need to see your ability to synthesize information,
think critically, and communicate your research effectively. Since writing is a
form of thinking, it is important for all junior researchers to complete their
own writing assignments so as to ensure that they thoughtfully clarify and
communicate their research ideas.
