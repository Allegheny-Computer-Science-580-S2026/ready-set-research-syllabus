# Ready, Set, Research! - Syllabus Repository for the Junior Seminar (CMPSC 580)

## Overview

This repository contains the comprehensive syllabus for **CMPSC 580: Junior
Seminar in Computer and Information Science**, offered during the Spring 2026
semester at Allegheny College. This course introduces students to independent
research methods in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Data Science, and
Informatics through a hands-on, project-based approach.

## We Are Not a Class, We Are a Research Group!

**CMPSC 580 operates as a research group**, not a traditional class with small
disconnected assignments. You should think of yourself as a member of a
university research laboratory or an industry R&D team, not as a student
completing coursework. In a research group:

- **We collaborate**: You'll share ideas, provide feedback on each other's work,
  and learn from your peers' research challenges and solutions.
- **We present regularly**: Like researchers at conferences and lab meetings,
  you'll present your progress, receive constructive critiques, and refine your
  ideas.
- **We maintain research artifacts**: Your research notebook, prototype
  repository, and journal entries are professional research outputs, not
  short-term assignments for a course that you complete exclusively for a grade.
- **We meet with advisers**: Your first reader (i.e., the course instructor) is
  your research adviser, and your weekly meetings are research consultations
  focused on advancing your project.
- **We contribute to the group**: Beyond your individual project, you contribute
  to the research culture through peer feedback, technical discussions, and shared
  learning about research methods in computer science, software engineering, data
  science, and informatics.

This semester, you are a **junior researcher** conducting original work. Your
prototype is a research artifact. Your report is a research publication. Your
presentations are research talks. Throughout this course, you should embrace
this identity and think like a researcher, not a student completing assignments!

## Research Group Purpose

As a member of the Junior Seminar research group, you will work alongside
other junior researchers to develop and execute original research projects.
During this single-semester research group experience, you will:

- **Develop** a unique research idea addressing a problem in computer and
  information science
- **Build** a working research prototype demonstrating your solution
- **Write** a complete five-chapter research report documenting your process and
  findings
- **Record** your ideas and brainstorms in a hand-written research notebook
- **Maintain** an online research journal reflecting on your experiences and
  growth
- **Present** your work to faculty and peers at multiple stages throughout the
  semester

## What Makes Our Research Group Different

Unlike the two-semester senior thesis research group (e.g., CMPSC 600/610), the
Junior Seminar research group is designed as an intensive, single-semester
research experience that:

- **Focuses** on completing all five chapters of a research report in one
  semester
- **Emphasizes** rapid prototyping and iterative development cycles common in
  agile research environments
- **Requires** concise research chapters (5-7 pages each) that communicate
  findings efficiently
- **Provides** regular structured milestones and in-person research meetings to
  maintain momentum
- **Prepares** you with research skills applicable to senior thesis research
  groups, graduate research labs, or industry R&D teams

## Research Group Meeting Structure

The research group meets three times per week, combining dedicated junior
researcher sessions with joint meetings alongside senior researchers:

- **Monday** (50 minutes): Junior researchers only for research presentations,
  collaborative work sessions, and peer critique
- **Wednesday** (50 minutes): Junior researchers only for research presentations,
  technical workshops, and individual research consultations
- **Friday** (50 minutes): Joint research meeting with senior researchers
  (CMPSC 600/610) for research methodologies, academic writing strategies,
  research ethics, and professional development

This structure provides dedicated time for junior-level research activities
while also creating opportunities to learn from and collaborate with senior
researchers who are further along in their research trajectories.

## Key Research Deliverables

### 1. Research Prototype (20% of grade)

You will develop a working prototype that demonstrates **both the
feasibility and the challenge** of your research concept. Your prototype
must show that your research idea is viable while also highlighting the
technical complexity and intellectual depth of the problem you are
addressing.

#### What Makes a Strong Research Prototype?

**Your prototype should demonstrate**:

- **Feasibility**: Proof that your research idea can be implemented and produces
  meaningful results
- **Challenge**: Evidence of technical depth, requiring significant
  problem-solving and implementation effort beyond trivial solutions or typical
  coursework projects
- **Research Contribution**: Clear connection to your research questions and
  hypotheses

#### Prototype Requirements

**Your prototype should be hosted in a GitHub repository with**:

- Comprehensive documentation explaining installation and usage
- Clear README with project overview and research context
- Example inputs/outputs demonstrating functionality
- Regular commit history throughout the semester
- Evidence of testing and validation
- Discussion of limitations and future improvements

**Critical**: Your prototype must be substantial enough to support a full
research report while being achievable in a single semester. Aim for depth over
breadth—it's better to thoroughly explore one aspect than to superficially cover
many. Please remember that you must build and release a research prototype that
you can demonstrate during an in-class presentation on Week 7. Finally,
don't forget that your prototype must be in a publicly available GitHub
repository and usable by the other members of our research group.

### 2. Research Report (30% of grade)

Your research report consists of five chapters that mirror the chapters you will
later write in your senior thesis for the 600- and 610-level courses:

1. **Introduction**: Problem statement, motivation, and contributions
1. **Related Work**: Literature review and context
1. **Methodology**: Research approach, tools, and methods
1. **Experimental Results**: Findings, analysis, and evaluation
1. **Conclusion and Future Work**: Summary, reflection, and next steps

Each chapter should be approximately 5-7 pages, resulting in a complete report
of at least 25 pages.

### 3. Research Journal (10% of grade)

You will maintain an online research journal with seven entries in total:

1. Research Idea
1. Prototype Installation and Use
1. Brainstorming and Prototyping Experience
1. Chapters 1 and 2 Reflections
1. Chapters 3 and 4 Reflections
1. Chapter 5 Reflection
1. Overall Project Reflection

Your journal will be built using Quarto and published via GitHub Pages.

### 4. Research Presentations (30% combined)

You will give three presentations throughout the semester:

- **Week 6**: Research Idea Pitch (3 min + 2 min Q&A)
- **Week 7**: Research Prototype Demonstration (3 min + 2 min Q&A)
- **Week 13**: Research Results Presentation (3 min + 2 min Q&A)

With approximately 20 students in the class, presentations are divided across
Monday and Wednesday sessions (i.e., 10 students per day). Each 50-minute class
accommodates all 10 presentations with strict, enforced time limits.

### 5. Research Group Participation (10% combined)

Regular attendance, active engagement in discussions, weekly meetings with your
first reader, and constructive peer feedback.

## Important Research Evaluation Policies

### Final Evaluations (Not Revisable)

The following research presentations receive a **final evaluation upon
completion** that is not subject to revision:

- **Research Idea Pitch Presentation** (Week 6)
- **Research Prototype Demonstration** (Week 7)
- **Research Results Presentation** (Week 13)

These presentations mirror real research talks at conferences and lab meetings.
They are evaluated based on your performance on the day of presentation.
Prepare thoroughly, as you will not have an opportunity to revise these
evaluations.

### Revisable Evaluations

The following research artifacts can be **revised and improved** throughout the
semester, with final evaluations based on the quality of your work at the final
submission deadline (May 1, 2026):

- **Research Journal Entries** (all 7 entries)
- **Research Prototype** (code, documentation, and repository quality)
- **Research Report Chapters** (all 5 chapters)

Your research adviser (i.e., your first reader who, for the Junior Seminar, is
the course instructor) will provide feedback on these artifacts as you develop
them, and you can incorporate this feedback to improve your work before the
final deadline. This iterative process mirrors how researchers revise
manuscripts and refine research outputs based on peer review.

## Working with Your Research Adviser

Throughout the semester, you will work closely with one faculty member who
serves as your research adviser:

- **First Reader / Research Adviser**: Your primary research mentor who you meet
  with weekly to advance your research project. For the Junior Seminar, this
  person is the course instructor. You should aim to meet with your research
  adviser on a weekly basis.

**Your research adviser will**:

- Guide your research direction and help you refine your research questions
- Provide critical feedback on research artifacts (journal entries, chapters,
  prototype)
- Hold weekly research consultations to discuss progress, challenges, and next
  steps
- Evaluate your research outputs and provide assessments
- Support your development as an independent researcher

**Weekly research meetings are mandatory**. Come prepared to these meetings with
questions, progress updates, preliminary results, and specific discussion
topics. Your success as a researcher depends heavily on maintaining regular
communication with your research adviser and actively engaging in the research
consultation process.

## Technology and Tools

The research group uses industry-standard and academic research tools:

- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and collaborative development
- **Quarto**: Document publishing system for research reports and journals
- **LaTeX**: Professional typesetting for research publications
- **Markdown**: Lightweight markup for technical documentation
- **Programming Languages/Frameworks**: As needed for your specific research
  project
- **Paper Research Notebook**: A bound research notebook for organizing and
  sharing your hand-written diagrams, equations, brainstorming notes, and task
  lists that you use to record your research process

Researchers are expected to set up their development environment early in the
semester. The research group provides a [starter
template](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-580-S2026/) that
includes all necessary configuration files and documentation.

## Research Evaluation and Assessment

The research group evaluates research outputs using a combination of primary
