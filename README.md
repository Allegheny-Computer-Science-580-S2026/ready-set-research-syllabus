# Ready, Set, Research! - Syllabus Repository for the Junior Seminar (CMPSC 580)

## Overview

This repository contains the comprehensive syllabus for **CMPSC 580: Junior
Seminar in Computer and Information Science**, offered during the Spring 2026
semester at Allegheny College. This course introduces students to independent
research methods in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Data Science, and
Informatics through a hands-on, project-based approach.

## Course Purpose

The Junior Seminar (CMPSC 580) serves as a critical stepping stone in your
academic journey, preparing you for the senior comprehensive project and
professional research work. During this single-semester course, you will:

- **Develop** a unique research idea addressing a problem in computer and
  information science
- **Build** a working research prototype demonstrating your solution
- **Write** a complete five-chapter research report documenting your process and
  findings
- **Record** your ideas and brainstorms in a hand-written research notebook
- **Maintain** a research journal reflecting on your experiences and growth
- **Present** your work to faculty and peers at multiple stages throughout the
  semester

## What Makes Junior Seminar Different

Unlike the two-semester senior thesis sequence (e.g., CMPSC 600/610), Junior
Seminar is designed as an intensive, single-semester research experience that:

- **Focuses** on completing all five chapters of a research report in one
  semester
- **Emphasizes** rapid prototyping and iterative development
- **Requires** shorter chapters (5-7 pages each) compared to senior thesis
  chapters (10-15 pages)
- **Provides** regular structured milestones and in-person activities to keep
  you on track
- **Prepares** you with research skills applicable to senior thesis, graduate
  school, or industry

## Class Meeting Structure

The Junior Seminar meets three times per week, with a mix of dedicated
sessions and joint meetings with the Senior Seminar:

- **Monday** (50 minutes): Junior Seminar only for student presentations,
  project work sessions, and peer feedback
- **Wednesday** (50 minutes): Junior Seminar only for student presentations,
  technical workshops, and individual consultations
- **Friday** (50 minutes): Joint session with Senior Seminar (e.g., CMPSC
  600/610) for collaborative research methods, academic writing, research ethics,
  and professional development

This structure provides dedicated time for junior-specific activities while
also allowing you to learn from and interact with senior students who are
further along in their research journey.

## Key Course Components

### 1. Research Prototype (20% of grade)

You will develop a working prototype that demonstrates **both the
feasibility and the challenge** of your research concept. Your prototype
must show that your research idea is viable while also highlighting the
technical complexity and intellectual depth of the problem you are
addressing.

#### What Makes a Strong Research Prototype?

Your prototype should demonstrate:

- **Feasibility**: Proof that your research idea can be implemented and produces
  meaningful results
- **Challenge**: Evidence of technical depth, requiring significant
  problem-solving and implementation effort beyond trivial solutions or a project
  that would be completed for a computer science course
- **Research Contribution**: Clear connection to your research questions and
  hypotheses

#### Prototype Requirements

Your prototype should be hosted in a GitHub repository with:

- Comprehensive documentation explaining installation and usage
- Clear README with project overview and research context
- Example inputs/outputs demonstrating functionality
- Regular commit history throughout the semester
- Evidence of testing and validation
- Discussion of limitations and future improvements

**Critical**: Your prototype must be substantial enough to support a full
research report while being achievable in a single semester. Aim for depth over
breadth—it's better to thoroughly explore one aspect than to superficially cover
many. Please remember that you must build and release a research prototype that
you can demonstrate during an in-class presentation during Week 7. Finally,
don't forget that your prototype must be in a publicly available GitHub
repository and usable by the other members of our research group.

### 2. Research Report (30% of grade)

Your research report consists of five chapters that mirror the chapters you will
later write in your senior thesis for the 600- and 610-level courses:

1. **Introduction**: Problem statement, motivation, and contributions
1. **Related Work**: Literature review and context
1. **Methodology**: Research approach, tools, and methods
1. **Experimental Results**: Findings, analysis, and evaluation
1. **Conclusion and Future Work**: Summary, reflection, and next steps

Each chapter should be approximately 5-7 pages, resulting in a complete report
of at least 25 pages.

### 3. Research Journal (10% of grade)

You will maintain an online research journal with seven entries in total:

1. Research Idea
1. Prototype Installation and Use
1. Brainstorming and Prototyping Experience
1. Chapters 1 and 2 Reflections
1. Chapters 3 and 4 Reflections
1. Chapter 5 Reflection
1. Overall Project Reflection

Your journal will be built using Quarto and published via GitHub Pages.

### 4. Research Presentations (30% combined)

You will give three presentations throughout the semester:

- **Week 6**: Research Idea Pitch (3 min + 2 min Q&A)
- **Week 7**: Research Prototype Demonstration (3 min + 2 min Q&A)
- **Week 13**: Research Results Presentation (3 min + 2 min Q&A)

With 20 students in the class, presentations are divided across Monday and
Wednesday sessions (10 students per day). Each 50-minute class accommodates
all 10 presentations with strict time limits.

### 5. Research Group Participation (10% combined)

Regular attendance, active engagement in discussions, weekly meetings with your
first reader, and constructive peer feedback.

## Important Grading Policies

### Final Grades (Not Revisable)

The following deliverables receive a **final grade upon completion** that is not
subject to revision:

- **Research Idea Pitch Presentation** (Week 6)
- **Research Prototype Demonstration** (Week 7)
- **Research Results Presentation** (Week 13)

These presentations are evaluated based on your performance on the day of
presentation. Prepare thoroughly, as you will not have an opportunity to revise
these grades.

### Revisable Grades

The following deliverables can be **revised and improved** throughout the
semester, with final grades based on the quality of your work at the final
submission deadline (May 1, 2026):

- **Research Journal Entries** (all 7 entries)
- **Research Prototype** (code, documentation, and repository quality)
- **Research Report Chapters** (all 5 chapters)

Your first reader will provide feedback on these deliverables as you complete
them, and you can incorporate this feedback to improve your work before the
final deadline.

## Working with Your First Reader

Throughout the semester, you will work closely with one faculty member who
serves as your first reader:

- **First Reader**: Your primary research advisor who you meet with weekly

Your first reader will:

- Guide your research direction and help you refine your ideas
- Provide feedback on all your deliverables (journal entries, chapters, prototype)
- Meet with you weekly to discuss progress and challenges
- Assess your work and assign grades for all deliverables
- Support your learning and growth as a researcher

**Weekly meetings are mandatory**. Come prepared with questions, updates, and
work to discuss. Your success in this course depends heavily on maintaining
regular communication with your first reader.

## Technology and Tools

This course uses industry-standard tools for research and development:

- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and repository hosting
- **Quarto**: Document publishing system for reports and journals
- **LaTeX**: Professional typesetting for your research report
- **Markdown**: Lightweight markup for documentation
- **Programming Languages/Frameworks**: As needed for your specific research project

Students are expected to set up their development environment early in the
semester. The course provides a [starter
template](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-580-S2026/) that
includes all necessary configuration files and documentation.
