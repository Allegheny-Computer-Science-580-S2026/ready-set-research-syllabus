# Ready, Set, Research! - Syllabus Repository for the Junior Seminar (CMPSC 580)

## Overview

This repository contains the comprehensive syllabus for **CMPSC 580: Junior
Seminar in Computer and Information Science**, offered during the Spring 2026
semester at Allegheny College. This course introduces students to independent
research methods in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Data Science, and
Informatics through a hands-on, project-based approach.

## Course Purpose

The Junior Seminar (CMPSC 580) serves as a critical stepping stone in your
academic journey, preparing you for the senior comprehensive project and
professional research work. During this single-semester course, you will:

- **Develop** a unique research idea addressing a problem in computer and
  information science
- **Build** a working research prototype demonstrating your solution
- **Write** a complete five-chapter research report documenting your process and
  findings
- **Maintain** a research journal reflecting on your experiences and growth
- **Present** your work to faculty and peers at multiple stages throughout the
  semester

## What Makes Junior Seminar Different

Unlike the two-semester senior thesis sequence (CMPSC 600/610), Junior Seminar
is designed as an intensive, single-semester research experience that:

- **Focuses** on completing all five chapters of a research report in one
  semester
- **Emphasizes** rapid prototyping and iterative development
- **Requires** shorter chapters (5-7 pages each) compared to senior thesis
  chapters (10-15 pages)
- **Provides** structured weekly milestones to keep you on track
- **Prepares** you with research skills applicable to senior thesis, graduate
  school, or industry

## Key Course Components

### 1. Research Prototype (20% of grade)

You will develop a working prototype that demonstrates your research concept.
This could be:

- A software tool or application
- A data analysis pipeline
- An algorithm implementation
- A system extension or framework
- A web-based platform or visualization

Your prototype should be hosted in a GitHub repository with comprehensive
documentation, clear installation instructions, and regular commit history
throughout the semester.

### 2. Research Report (40% of grade)

Your research report consists of five chapters:

1. **Introduction**: Problem statement, motivation, and contributions
1. **Related Work**: Literature review and context
1. **Methodology**: Research approach, tools, and methods
1. **Experimental Results**: Findings, analysis, and evaluation
1. **Conclusion and Future Work**: Summary, reflection, and next steps

Each chapter should be approximately 5-7 pages, resulting in a complete report
of at least 25 pages.

### 3. Research Journal (10% of grade)

You will maintain an online research journal with seven entries:

1. Research Idea
1. Prototype Installation and Use
1. Brainstorming and Prototyping Experience
1. Chapters 1 and 2 Reflections
1. Chapters 3 and 4 Reflections
1. Chapter 5 Reflection
1. Overall Project Reflection

Your journal will be built using Quarto and published via GitHub Pages.

### 4. Presentations (30% combined)

You will give three presentations throughout the semester:

- **Week 6**: Research Idea Pitch (10 min + 5 min Q&A)
- **Week 7**: Research Prototype Demonstration (10 min + 5 min Q&A)
- **Week 13**: Research Results Presentation (15 min + 5 min Q&A)

### 5. Participation (10% combined)

Regular attendance, active engagement in discussions, meetings with your first
and second readers, and constructive peer feedback.

## Working with Your Readers

Throughout the semester, you will work closely with two faculty readers:

- **First Reader**: Your primary research advisor who you meet with weekly
- **Second Reader**: Provides additional perspective and meets with you regularly

Both readers will review your work, provide feedback, and assess your progress
throughout the semester.

## Technology and Tools

This course uses industry-standard tools for research and development:

- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and repository hosting
- **Quarto**: Document publishing system for reports and journals
- **LaTeX**: Professional typesetting for your research report
- **Markdown**: Lightweight markup for documentation
- **Programming Languages/Frameworks**: As needed for your specific research project

Students are expected to set up their development environment early in the
semester. The course provides a [starter
template](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-580-S2026/) that
includes all necessary configuration files and documentation.
